# Enhancing Road Safety with AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by predicting accident-prone areas using AI and machine learning. By analyzing historical traffic accident data, we identify key risk factors and provide actionable insights.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze patterns in traffic accident data.
- Predict accident severity using ML models.
- Identify high-risk zones and suggest preventive strategies.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Folder Structure

- – Sample datasets
-  – Python source code files:
  - `data_preprocessing.py`
  - `model_training.py`
  - `test_prediction.py`
- – Jupyter notebooks
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `report.pdf` – Final project report

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train the Model

```bash
cd src
python model_training.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Model trained successfully.
```

### Step 3: Run a Test Prediction

```bash
python test_prediction.py
```

**Expected Output Example:**
```
Predicted Severity: 2
```

---

## Sample Output

```bash
Model trained successfully.
Predicted Severity: 2
```

---

## Optional: Run Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
