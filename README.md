# Enhancing Road Safety with AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by predicting accident-prone areas using machine learning models. By analyzing historical traffic accident data, we identify key risk factors and provide actionable insights.

## Objective
- Analyze traffic accident patterns
- Predict high-risk areas using AI
- Suggest preventive measures for safety

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Python scripts
- `data/`: Sample dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook walkthrough
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
- `report.pdf`: Final project report

## How to Run
